My hypothesis is that the way I come across in the ad and my message isn't attracting the right crowd. Also, I funnel hacked the voice memo from the competition that is sending out these very memos outbound and are getting very good quality clients. So there I guess I need 1) your feedback for the script and 2) get a system to find the right leads via IG / following lists. \"Hey, hey my friend, I just saw that we have some mutual friends, and even some of my clients. And you're currently single, right? If that's the case, this might be really interesting for you because we’ve basically established the first done-for-you Tinder agency. What that means is that we log in to Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, etc., on behalf of our clients, and really help them to get 1-2 dates per week. We do this by taking care of all the texting, but also by scheduling the dates, organizing everything, updating the profiles, working on the pictures—all those things to make sure that our clients meet the best women possible. We help them either find a girlfriend or have a little fun, depending on what they’re currently looking for. And of course, we save them a lot of time, allowing them to focus much more on their own business, while having someone by their side who takes care of all of it. So in the end, all they have to do is show up for the date. If this sounds interesting for you too, just let me know, my friend. If not, no worries at all. Have a great day, and talk to you soon! Ciao!\" This is what the competition is using, but they have a done-for-you texting offer which I don't have, so I need to adjust it slightly. This is what I got from one guy, and this is what I got from another guy: \"Hey man, how is it going? Just contacted you because I could see we had a lot of common friends but also some clients of mine are actually on your Instagram. I am not sure why we haven't talked before, but I was thinking you are also in sigma right? If that's the case, then this might be very interesting for you, because we set up the first Tinder texting agency. I guess you already seen it a bit, but basically we take over the control of tinder, bumble and so on and help our clients organize 1-2 dates every single week from their calendars depending on their location obviously. We also optimize the pictures, the profiles, bio all these things to really help them to attract the highest caliber of girls on these profiles. We do this for one obviously to find a girlfriend but also for some casual fun. If that sounds also interesting for you then let me know my friend, if not no worries at all, have a great day. Bye bye\" And then I would have to figure out how to send those voice memos at scale with a VA without me having to re-record them again and again."

To me key metrics for the ad is CPC, CTR, HOOK/HOLD RATES, CPF (cost per follower). Even though here CPF and CPC could also indicate higher quality leads but then together with CTR and H/H rates, it goes more context on how CPC/CPF is to be interpreted? For the mid part follower/clicks ratio and also general temperature in the DMs and sales calls, and maybe show up rate. Is there anything else? For the bottom part closing rate, conversion rates in the DMs. Would love to have your take on which metrics are the most relevant."

One of my main concerns is understanding if a higher Cost Per Follower (CPF) is acceptable because it attracts high-quality leads, or if it’s simply inefficient. I find it challenging to measure the “quality” of followers since much of it feels like gut instinct rather than data-backed decisions. I’d like a more structured approach to assess follower quality and engagement so that I can avoid wasting ad spend on followers who don’t convert or engage meaningfully. Another issue I face is the length of the sales cycle—it’s inefficient to wait until conversions happen to assess the effectiveness of these ads. I need intermediate metrics that can guide me on when to keep running or pausing an ad. I’ve also been considering lead form ads or DM ads as an alternative, but I’m not sure how to balance capturing qualified leads without significantly increasing costs. I’m interested in exploring lead magnets or low-ticket offers as a way to filter leads, but I’d need guidance on the best structure and process for this. Ultimately, I’m looking for a systematic way to decide which ads to keep running, especially for follower growth, without relying solely on “gut feeling.”"

Are there particular engagement metrics that indicate whether I should keep running an ad or kill it? Given a limited ad budget, what would be an achievable benchmark for CPF (Cost Per Follower) if I’m aiming for high-quality leads? If I was to do a systematic approach, in assessing the best targeting then the best creative, I feel there is no rigorous way of split testing this efficiently through follower ads on IG. Do you just recommend relying on gut feeling or doing different types of testing first? Is my targeting approach good by choosing niche luxury brands in order to weed out brokies who just like LV or Gucci? If I shift from follower ads to lead magnets or low-ticket offers, what would be the best format for my audience (e.g., PDF guide, mini-course, or community access)? How should I test these formats cost-effectively to see which attracts and qualifies leads the best? If I use lead forms with a lead magnet, how can I nurture leads systematically to gauge quality before moving them to a higher-commitment action (e.g., booking a call)? What steps should I include in a nurturing funnel that builds enough interest and qualifies leads further? I am currently considering doing a few reels selling a bunch of lead magnets and then plug it into many chats and then follow up with VSL video or mini-course. What do you recommend in that regard?"

My hypothesis is that the way I come across in the ad and my message isn't attracting the right crowd. Also, I funnel hacked the voice memo from the competition that is sending out these very memos outbound and are getting very good quality clients. So there I guess I need 1) your feedback for the script and 2) get a system to find the right leads via IG / following lists. \"Hey, hey my friend, I just saw that we have some mutual friends, and even some of my clients. And you're currently single, right? If that's the case, this might be really interesting for you because we’ve basically established the first done-for-you Tinder agency. What that means is that we log in to Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, etc., on behalf of our clients, and really help them to get 1-2 dates per week. We do this by taking care of all the texting, but also by scheduling the dates, organizing everything, updating the profiles, working on the pictures—all those things to make sure that our clients meet the best women possible. We help them either find a girlfriend or have a little fun, depending on what they’re currently looking for. And of course, we save them a lot of time, allowing them to focus much more on their own business, while having someone by their side who takes care of all of it. So in the end, all they have to do is show up for the date. If this sounds interesting for you too, just let me know, my friend. If not, no worries at all. Have a great day, and talk to you soon! Ciao!\" This is what the competition is using, but they have a done-for-you texting offer which I don't have, so I need to adjust it slightly. This is what I got from one guy, and this is what I got from another guy: \"Hey man, how is it going? Just contacted you because I could see we had a lot of common friends but also some clients of mine are actually on your Instagram. I am not sure why we haven't talked before, but I was thinking you are also in sigma right? If thats the case, then this might be very interesting for you, because we set up the first Tinder texting agency. I guess you already seen it a bit, but basically we take over the control of tinder, bumble and so on and help our clients organize 1-2 dates every single week from their calendars depending on their location obviously. We also optimize the pictures, the profiles, bio all these things to really help them to attract the highest caliber of girls on these profiles. We do this for one obviously to ifnd a girlfriend but also for some casual fun. If that sounds also interesting for you then let me know my friend, if not no worries at all, have a great day. Bye bye\" And then I would have to figure out how to send those voice memos at scale with a VA without me having to re-record them again and again."

Are there particular engagement metrics that indicate whether I should keep running an ad or kill it? Given a limited ad budget, what would be an achievable benchmark for CPF (Cost Per Follower) if I’m aiming for high-quality leads? If I was to do a systematic approach, in assessing the best targeting then the best creative, I feel there is no rigorous way of split testing this efficiently through follower ads on IG. Do you just recommend relying on gut feeling or doing different types of testing first? Is my targeting approach good by choosing niche luxury brands in order to weed out brokies who just like LV or Gucci? If I shift from follower ads to lead magnets or low-ticket offers, what would be the best format for my audience (e.g., PDF guide, mini-course, or community access)? How should I test these formats cost-effectively to see which attracts and qualifies leads the best? If I use lead forms with a lead magnet, how can I nurture leads systematically to gauge quality before moving them to a higher-commitment action (e.g., booking a call)? What steps should I include in a nurturing funnel that builds enough interest and qualifies leads further? I am currently considering doing a few reels selling a bunch of lead magnets and then plug it into many chats and then follow up with VSL video or mini-course. What do you recommend in that regard? To circle back to pt1, I killed ad 2 and 3, but then kept running ad 1 which doesn't include the luxury targeting, it only targets interest entrepreneurship and NL, Switzerland, Germany, Austria. Right now I am undecided whether I should keep it running or delete the ad, and choose a new targeting such as: NL, CH, ... and maybe add a few more countries and then add more niche targetings such as \"Aman Resorts, A. Lange & Söhne, Loro Piana, Princess Yachts, Bridgestone Golf, Savile Row, Abercrombie & Kent, Gieves & Hawkes, TurboTax, Vacheron Constantin, Ermenegildo Zegna, Titleist, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, Cleveland Golf, Audemars Piguet, NetJets, La Martina, Eleven Madison Park, Breguet (watch), Zoho Office Suite, TaylorMade-Adidas, Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, Richard Mille, Brunello Cucinelli\" An interesting idea I was having is the following: Meta optimizes on what you give it, here: the profile visits. Hence this also includes all the haters that I am still getting on ad1 (even after 2 weeks of running it), so the audience subdivides into haters and people who resonate. My gut feeling is that if I target richer people with the narrow interest groups, it will get less haters since rich people usually don't spend lots of time online spamming around, and thus the algorithm reinforces less on those. Also I should probably use ad2 on them as it has more high-quality B rolls, etc and thus would probably get more engagement. I saw that last night on the"

Jeremy Pogue says 40-50k per month mark is where you hire CSM. I am also concerned that he uses me as a springboard to go do his own thing. for instance he says let me grow my audience in the NL and bring you clients that way. I'm not sure what to think about that. Luckily I broke everything down into systems and independent roles I have a call with him tomorrow after our call. We will have to discuss payment before I reach the 40-50k IP, NDA, noncompetitive agreement role/responsibilities that I can expect for the money I am paying him. Right now I am barely making money so I think that it doesn't make sense to hire him right now and I am also paranoid of him having access to key insights and assets in my business such as the modelling interviews which give me an edge compared to the competition because we know exactly what type of content works to attract a certain archetype.

The reality is that you don't have a solid customer acquisition system and when you do get appointments, they're not qualified and you're just wasting your time. And you're probably stagnating around 3k€-15k€/m. So if that's you and you want to finally start filling your calendar with qualified, pre-sold leads on your automated offer to scale up to +20k-30k€/month. Then follow me here on Instagram and on my YouTube channel in which I share all the processes that work for us that have enabled us to generate 45k€ in 6 days and for all our coaching clients that we've scaled to 10k€-20k€ and even 30k€/m cash. Using the same processes, we helped Dorian go from 3k to 27k€/m Lucas from 1k to 30k€/m And even Léo from 3k€ to 24k€/m So if you want to discover all our processes for finally eliminating your customer acquisition problem forever and scaling to +de 20k-30k€/m, just follow me here on Instagram and on YouTube in which I reveal literally everything. (This might be the last time you see me, so make sure you subscribe now to watch later). 2: I helped a coach scale from €3k to €27k/m in 5 months thanks to systemic automation. Scaling your business is never about hard work, but about implementing the right systems. A good setting process, closing at 1900€ Pay In Full, automations, deliverables, Upsells and even downsells. All these systems will enable you to convert all the attention you generate today with Instagram and redirect it to a second platform such as YouTube to further educate prospects. Stop selling and start pre-selling if you want to scale to 20k-30k€/m Follow me here on Instagram and on YouTube, where I literally tell you everything about scaling. (It might be the last time you see me don’t miss out) 3: The reason coaches can't scale up to 20k-30k€/m is not lack of desire but lack of systems in their business. We've scaled a coach from 1k€ to 30k€/m cash, building a team of 3 A-players and improving his personal brand with just a few processes. I myself recently generated +45k€ in 6 days, just by implementing the right systems in the right places. It's all a question of your inputs determining your outputs. If I were to look at your daily actions, there's one piece of advice I'd give you straight away, and that's to x10 your daily actions to x10 your results. By the way, if you want more tips like this that will finally enable you to fill your calendar with 3-4-5 qualified appointments a day so that you finally scale to 20k€-30k€/m, follow me here on Instagram and YouTube, I share daily tips for free that will finally unlock your stagnation. You tell me what do you think about them to start?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It's strong and has the authority but the hook needs to be tightened. The first sentence can be shorter and punchier to grab attention faster. Too many details about processes and numbers might lose some viewers. Focus on one or two main points. The final CTA should feel more urgent and benefit-driven. I would do it like this but edit as needed: The biggest problem in your coaching business? You’re stuck between €3k and €15k/month because you don’t have a solid customer acquisition system. Imagine filling your calendar with qualified, pre-sold leads and scaling to €20k-30k/month on autopilot. Using this system, we helped: Dorian: from €3k to €27k/month. Lucas: from €1k to €30k/month. Léo: from €3k to €24k/month. I share these exact processes on my Instagram and YouTube. Follow me now to unlock the strategies that will eliminate your customer acquisition problems forever. (This might be the last time you see me don’t miss out!) For script 2: Add more clarity to \"good setting process\" and \"1900€ Pay In Full\" for audiences who might not immediately understand those terms. Avoid overloading the audience with jargon (e.g., \"upsells\" and \"downsells\"). How I would revise it is like this: Coaches, scaling your business isn’t about working harder it’s about building the right systems. I helped a coach scale from €3k to €27k/month in just 5 months by automating client acquisition, improving deliverables, and creating upsell strategies that convert attention into cash. Stop selling and start pre-selling to scale your business to €20k-30k/month. Follow me here on Instagram and YouTube to see the exact systems we use to help coaches grow fast. (This might be the last time you see me don’t miss out!) For script 3: Focus on one transformation or result to keep the message concise. Use less of the word \"systems\" by replacing it with synonyms or explanations. And make the CTA more specific to highlight the value of following. Here's my revision for script 3: Most coaches can’t scale to €20k-30k/month not because they lack ambition, but because they lack the right systems. I recently generated €45k in just 6 days and helped a coach grow from €1k to €30k/month by building the right team and automating key processes. Scaling isn’t about working harder it’s about aligning your daily actions with proven systems. If you want 3-5 qualified appointments every day and a calendar full of pre-sold leads, follow me here on Instagram and YouTube. I share free, actionable strategies daily that will unlock your growth."

      "content": "Start with 70% of the budget for these follower ads (e.g., €35-70/day). Focus on building your audience first because it gives your brand more credibility and warms up potential prospects. Run 2-3 versions of the follower ads targeting different audiences (e.g., interest-based, lookalike, and broad targeting). Allocate about €15-25/day per version, depending on your total daily budget. Check CTR and CPC daily and turn off any underperforming ads in 3-4 days. Use the remaining 30% of the budget (e.g., €15-30/day) for your direct offer ads. The goal here is to test whether the offer resonates with a cold audience while you grow your follower base. Start with a warm audience (followers or page visitors if you have any data yet). If warm audiences are limited, use broad interest-based targeting related to your niche. Run 2 versions of the direct offer ad (different copy or creatives) at around €10-15/day each. Focus on conversions optimize for actions like DM inquiries or form submissions. After 7 days or the initial testing, look at the data (CPF, CPA, and ROAS). Reallocate more budget to the top-performing ad (follower or direct offer) while scaling gradually. Use retargeting for warm leads (those who’ve interacted with the follower ads) and push them toward the direct offer ad. Keep the testing tight, and after 2 weeks, you should have enough insights to scale the most effective campaign. For these ones, the hook is strong but add more urgency or exclusivity could make it even sharper. For example: \"Are you a €3,000+ a month coach who's tired of chasing clients? Imagine having 20-25 qualified appointments weekly on autopilot... Let me show you how.\" Use visuals to amplify the idea of the dream schedule. A clip of an iCal packed with appointments could work alongside the copy. Build urgency by addressing a pain point and framing it as a solution: \"Coaches: If you're not booking 3-5 qualified appointments daily, you're leaving money on the table. Here's how to fix that...\" Add a subtle benefit to the \"send me the word '30k'\" CTA. For example: \"DM me the word '30k,' and let's map out your growth plan today.\" Highlight real testimonials or snippets from Lucas, Leo, and Dorian's stories. \"Lucas, a sports coach, scaled from €1k to €30k/month in under 90 days by following this exact system. Your story could be next.\" The process breakdown can also be simpler: Step 1: Craft a unique, irresistible offer that positions you as the premium choice. Step 2: Run laser-targeted ads that bring ideal clients to you on autopilot. Step 3: Implement systems that let you scale sustainably while focusing on growth."

That is how you stand out in the market because most only promise vague results like \"get more leads,\" but when you focus on structured systems tied to client acquisition, it shows that you bring a repeatable, scalable, and proven solution. Instead of saying, \"We’ll help you get more clients,\" you could say: \"With our Client Acquisition Flowchart and SOPs, we’ve helped 60+ coaches automate their businesses and book 20-25 appointments weekly, hands-free.\" or \"Leo used our copy-paste SOPs to scale from €3K to €24K/month in 90 days without guesswork.\" When you present your systems as your unique mechanism, it makes you different. No one else is doing exactly this in the French market. What I would do is to start creating content (Reels, Carousels, Stories) explaining why your systems work and how they save clients time and effort. Tie everything back to client acquisition because that’s the ultimate goal and make it super simple for them: “With our systems, you’ll stop wasting time guessing we’ve already done the work for you.” Frame it as exclusive: “Our systems are proprietary and designed to eliminate all the guesswork in scaling your business.” Focus on the results your systems create and make that your main selling point. Systems + client acquisition = your angle."

Consider using a bolder statement, fast-paced visual, or sound effect to hold attention. Make the CTA feel urgent \"Follow now to learn how\" or “DM us ‘Growth’ today”. Ad 2: Make sure that messaging explicitly speaks to your target audience (e.g., \"Fitness Coaches, this is for you!\") to pre-qualify the viewers. If there are any slower parts in the reel, tighten them to keep retention high. Ad 3: Include subtle logos, brand colors, or even a consistent tagline at the end for brand recall. Add the CTA earlier in the ad, around the midpoint, not just at the end. Generally, people drop off in the first 3 seconds, so focus on bold hooks. A shocking stat or a quick transformation visual can be powerful. Experiment with headlines that are hyper-targeted like, “Coaches tired of no-shows? Watch this.” or “Want 20 calls booked every week?” Ensure that captions/subtitles are always visible since many people watch on mute. Ask a question or make a polarizing statement to drive comments. You can also reply to comments to boost engagement further. Check the CTR engagement (likes/comments), and CPM after the first few days. Cut the ad with the weakest performance and reallocate budget to the top ones. If any of these ads are attracting irrelevant followers (minors or from Africa as discussed earlier), refine your targeting filters by adjusting age, location, or interests."

Cool g, you got a loom of how it works and all? But I'm a little confused cuz Nik sent me a different outreach script from the one you recommend @IsaiahLebron  >> ⁠1-on-1-beeminet⁠."

IG could temporarily shadow some messages to prevent spam behavior lol. Wait for 24 hours and check again. Sometimes, DMs appear later in the inbox. G’s algorithm can limit outreach if it suspects bot-like behavior. When this happens, some DMs might not go through without triggering an error. Reduce the daily DM volume slightly to avoid triggering flags (e.g., back to 40-45 DMs/account). Make the DMs highly personalized to appear less automated. There’s a chance your manual count in the DMs doesn’t reflect all messages sent (e.g., archived or hidden requests). Check the \"Requests\" tab in the DMs; some messages may land there. Search your sent messages by scrolling through the inbox or using account activity tools. Newer accounts typically face stricter limits on daily DM activity. If the accounts you’re using are relatively new, the cap might be lower. these are possible things that could be happening."
